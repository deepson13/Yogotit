    <h2>Number System</h2>
    <p>A number system is a way of expressing numbers in a consistent manner using a set of symbols or digits. The most widely used number system is the decimal system, which is base-10 and uses the digits 0-9. In the world of computing, however, the binary system (base-2) is crucial because computers process information in binary form, using only two digits: 0 and 1. These binary digits are known as bits, and they are the fundamental building blocks of all digital information.</p>

    <p>In addition to binary, there are other number systems such as the octal (base-8) and hexadecimal (base-16) systems. While binary is essential for computing, octal and hexadecimal are often used because they offer more compact representations of binary data. For example, one hexadecimal digit can represent four binary digits (bits), which makes it easier to work with large binary numbers, especially in programming and digital electronics.</p>

    <h3>Conversion Between Number Systems</h3>
    <p>Converting between number systems is a critical skill in computer science and digital electronics. For example, converting from binary to decimal (and vice versa) involves understanding the place values in each system. In binary, the place values increase as powers of 2, while in decimal, the place values increase as powers of 10. Conversion to hexadecimal and octal is also essential in computer programming, where these systems are used to represent memory addresses or color codes in web design.</p>

    <h2>Boolean Logic</h2>
    <p>Boolean logic, developed by mathematician George Boole, is a form of algebra that operates with binary values, typically true and false (or 1 and 0). It is the foundation of digital circuits and plays a crucial role in computer science. Boolean logic is used to design circuits that perform various operations such as addition, multiplication, and decision-making processes in programming.</p>

    <p>There are three primary Boolean operators:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AND:</strong> The AND operator returns true if both operands are true. In digital circuits, it is represented by a series of switches in series.</li>
        <li><strong>OR:</strong> The OR operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true. In digital circuits, this is represented by switches in parallel.</li>
        <li><strong>NOT:</strong> The NOT operator inverts the value of the operand. It returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Applications of Boolean Logic</h3>
    <p>Boolean logic is not only fundamental in designing computer circuits but also in programming. In programming languages like C, Java, and Python, Boolean expressions are used for decision-making (e.g., if-else statements) and looping (e.g., while and for loops). Understanding Boolean logic is essential for both hardware and software developers to solve problems efficiently and logically.</p>
